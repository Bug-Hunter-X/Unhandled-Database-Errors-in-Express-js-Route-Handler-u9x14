# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors during database queries within route handlers.

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that fetches user data.  It correctly handles the case where a user is not found, but fails to handle errors that might occur during the database query itself (e.g., connection errors, query execution failures).

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler, incorporating proper error handling using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully manage database-related exceptions.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling for building reliable and resilient web applications.
